## Introduction

CodeChef is a competitive programming platform that hosts monthly contests and challenges to sharpen your coding abilities. This repository aims to provide solutions to CodeChef problems to aid in your learning journey. Each problem solution is organized within its respective folder, along with the problem statement, input/output specifications, and the solution code.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a structured folder hierarchy, making it easy to navigate and find specific problem solutions. Here's an overview of the folder structure:

```
.
├── Difficulty-name
│   ├── problem-code
│   │   ├── problem-statement.md
│   │   ├── input-specification.md
│   │   ├── output-specification.md
│   │   └── solution.cpp
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

- The `Difficulty-name` directory represents level of difficulty of problems on CodeChef.
- Within each contest directory, you'll find individual `problem-code` folders corresponding to the problem's unique identifier.
- Each problem folder contains the following files:
  - `problem-statement.md`: The problem statement describing the task and requirements.
  - `input-specification.md`: The specifications for the input format.
  - `output-specification.md`: The specifications for the output format.
  - `solution.cpp` (or other programming language files): The solution code to the problem.

## How to Use

To make the most of this repository and explore the problem solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the desired problem folder within the appropriate contest directory.
3. Read the `problem-statement.md` file to understand the problem requirements.
4. Review the `input-specification.md` file to understand the expected input format.
5. Explore the `output-specification.md` file to understand the expected output format.
6. Open the solution code file (`solution.cpp` or other languages) to examine the implementation.
7. Run the solution code on your local machine, provide the input as per the specifications, and verify the output.
8. Feel free to modify the solution code, optimize it, or try different approaches to solve the problem.
9. Repeat the above steps for other problems and contests as desired.
